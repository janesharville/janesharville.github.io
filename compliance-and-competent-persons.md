## Meeting Compliance. Providing Competence.

Whatever type of business you run there will be a level of compliance that you must meet in terms of health and safety. The requirement is for your business to have access to competent advice and guidance and to use this in order to comply with the law. The law states that employers are required by the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations to appoint one or more competent persons to assist them with health and safety.
