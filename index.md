### Introduction
Amber Green Safety is a Sussex-based consultancy providing health and safety advice, guidance and training. We aim to take the mystery out of health and safety and ‘Free the Myth’ that it builds barriers to running your business effectively. Health and safety looks after the well-being of people and allows organisations to operate confidently, more efficiently and without delays on projects. Its procedures are based on simple common sense and respect for the working individual, not making life harder for everyone.

### How we work
We provide uncomplicated, cost-effective advice and guidance, offering simple solutions and programmes that you can understand and use to your advantage. We don’t interfere with the smooth running of your business but address the issues that matter. We help make you aware of where risks exist and what your responsibilities are, and suggest the most straightforward course of action you can take.

You can’t put a price on a happy, healthy and safe working environment: the value speaks for itself. However, in these demanding times, we are confident that our charges among the lowest you will find, and we will match or even better any comparable quotation.
