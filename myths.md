## Dispelling The Myths

* Good health and safety advice is not about picking up on every trivial, low-risk detail.
* Good health and safety does not bring healthy businesses grinding to a halt.
* Good health and safety is not based on over-reacting to reasonable risks
* Good health and safety practitioners are not on power trips.

The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) asks us to apply common sense controls where real risks are evident in order to bring risks down to tolerable levels or otherwise remove them completely. Often, observing this involves implementing a basic set of tasks that are easy to manage.
