#### Health and safety when bidding for new business
Procurement professionals provide high marks to organisations whose tenders respond confidently and comprehensively to questions on their health and safety credentials. In fact, it’s such an important aspect of a winning bid that no matter how strong the rest of your submission, a poor health and safety response can result in an immediate fail. We can manage the health and safety response within your tender submissions, setting out content that precisely answers the questions, submitting proof of compliance, and increasing your chances of bid success.
