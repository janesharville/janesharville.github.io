## Special offers for new clients

### Consultancy service

Try one full day’s consultation for £175 (normally £350). We can cover a lot of ground in one day, often discussing and identifying issues and providing advice on the right course of action, all within the one-day review. It’s a good way to discover how we work, and to see how painless health and safety can be.

### Small business package

For organisations with 25 employees or fewer, we can design a health and safety policy that perfectly fits your business. For £600 we will develop a policy document, a simple health and safety management system and controls that are appropriate for your size of business. We can provide a similar service for larger organisations, with costs scaled to reflect the number of employees.
